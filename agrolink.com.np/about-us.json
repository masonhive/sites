The concept draws on both the scientific tradition of ecological sciences as well as the traditional knowledge and expertise of small-scale farmers, especially women and Indigenous farmers. \nThe two most important assets of small-scale farmers are their variety of locally adapted seeds, and their knowledge and brain power. These assets allow them to grow healthy food without harming the environment.  We are excited to bring good movement towards sustainable development via agriculture and for families."
